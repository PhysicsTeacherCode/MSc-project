# Replicating *The Statistical Mechanics of Twitter Communities* Using the Bluesky Social Network

This repository is an attempt to reproduce — and adapt — the results of the article:

> **Gavin Hall and William Bialek (2019)** — *The Statistical Mechanics of Twitter Communities*
> DOI: **10.1088/1742-5468/ab3af0**

The main goal is to investigate whether the same statistical properties observed in Twitter communities also emerge in the **Bluesky** social network.

---

## 📌 Motivation

The original paper uses statistical mechanics tools to analyze user interactions, uncovering patterns such as:

* Community formation
* Correlations between users
* Network structure
* Distribution of influence and connectivity

With the rise of Bluesky and its open API, this project explores whether similar phenomena arise on a more decentralized platform — or if new behavioral dynamics emerge.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Collect public Bluesky interaction data.
* Build network graphs (followers, posts and interactions).
* Apply methods inspired by the paper, such as:

  * Pairwise correlation matrices
  * The Maximun Entropy models for social interactions
* Investigate how structural differences between Twitter and Bluesky communities affect the statistical outcomes.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python 3.x**
* **Bluesky API**
* Main libraries:

  * `pandas`
  * `matplotlib` / `seaborn`
  * `requests`
  * `time`
  * `concurrent.futures` (for time optmization)
* Jupyter Notebooks for analysis workflows.

## 📊 Data

Data is collected directly from the public Bluesky API.
Depending on Bluesky’s data policies, *raw data may not be included* and may instead be reconstructed via provided scripts.
